# Get video transcripts and data from a database

This is a Node app that provides an API to get data from the database (stored by the [put app](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dev-video-search/tree/master/src/put)).

For testing, you can run this locally with the app running from localhost.

The live version runs on [Nodejitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) at shearch.me, for queries like this: [shearch.me?captions=svg&speaker=alex](http://shearch.me/?captions=svg&speaker=alex) (same as [shearch.me?c=svg&s=alex](http://shearch.me/?c=svg&s=alex)).

For more examples, see this repo's [README](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dev-video-search/blob/master/README.md).
